# Screens demo

This is a [Watchy](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/) watchface based on [Watchy-Screen](https://github.com/charles-haynes/Watchy-Screen) intended to demonstrate a multi-screen watchface.

It includes screens for:

* Time/Date
* Current Weather/Location
* Battery Status
* Bluetooth Status
* Orientation
* Settings
  * Set Time
  * Setup Wifi
  * Update face via BLE OTA
* Steps
* Wifi Status

## UI
`up` moves up in that list. 
`down` moves down. 
`back` takes you back to the first screen - the time/date screen.
`menu` displays the value/sub-screen for that item, `back` returns from the value

The implementations should be clear from the code. Sorry for the lack of screenshots.
